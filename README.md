#Notepad Application 
This project is a Python-based Notepad application developed to demonstrate the use of various libraries for GUI creation, file handling, and efficient data management.

Key Features:

Library Utilization:
The application integrates several Python libraries to enhance functionality and user experience. Tkinter is used for building a responsive graphical user interface (GUI), while additional libraries such as os and tkinter.filedialog are used for file operations like creating, opening, saving, and exporting text documents.

Data Handling:
The Notepad efficiently manages user inputs, file content, and session data. It handles both temporary data (in-memory editing) and persistent data (file saving and loading), ensuring that user information is managed securely and effectively.

User-Friendly Interface:
Designed with usability in mind, the application features a clean, intuitive interface with basic text editing functionalities such as new file creation, text editing, saving, and opening existing files.

Scalability and Extensibility:
The modular design allows easy extension of features, such as adding syntax highlighting, auto-save functionality, or cloud-based file storage integration.
